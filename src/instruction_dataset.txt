You will probably not find any existing dataset, and it is your job to build a training set for the
NLP component (as well as a test set). 

Be careful to include various kinds of trash texts, and more important that real orders ex-
plore the variety of grammatical structures.

As every person write differently, you will get a much wider dataset with more diversity if you do
it collectively, on any collaborative media (Teams, Discord, Github, ...).

On the other hand, the dataset timetables.csv, used for the pathfinder, is given to you at the start
of the project. So you can evaluate the performance of your algorithm as you build it.

For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that changes do not cost any additional time (duration
from A to C through B = duration from A to B + duration from B to C).

You may also use SNCF open data information to have town names instead of station names.
